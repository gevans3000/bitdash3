# BitDash3 â€” 5-Minute Bitcoin Profit Dashboard

**Mission:** Help users identify 2-3 profitable Bitcoin trading opportunities daily from 5-minute chart analysis

**Development Philosophy:** Mock data by default (`npm run dev`), real APIs only on manual refresh to respect rate limits, make ure to use low code and minimal compute, maximum performance, sole purpose is to generate buy/sell signals for BTC/USDT on the 5-minute timeframe
