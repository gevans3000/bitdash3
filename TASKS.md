# BitDash3 — 5-Minute Bitcoin Profit Dashboard

**Mission:** Help users identify 2-3 profitable Bitcoin trading opportunities daily from 5-minute chart analysis

**Development Philosophy:** Mock data by default (`npm run dev`), real APIs only on manual refresh to respect rate limits, make ure to use low code and minimal compute, maximum performance, sole purpose is to generate buy/sell signals for BTC/USDT on the 5-minute timeframe

---

## 💡 Key Information for Profitable Trading Decisions (User Perspective)

To empower users to make profitable 5-minute Bitcoin trading choices, the dashboard must clearly present the following, derived from the system's analysis:

1.  **Core Signal & Rationale:**
    *   **Actionable Signal:** Prominent "BUY", "SELL", or "HOLD" status.
    *   **Signal Confidence:** A percentage indicating the strength of the signal (e.g., "75% Confidence").
    *   **Reason for Signal:** A concise explanation of the primary drivers (e.g., "EMA Crossover confirmed by Bullish RSI Momentum").

2.  **Market Context:**
    *   **Current Market Regime:** Clearly display "Strong Trend", "Weak Trend", or "Ranging" to set expectations.
    *   **Active Strategy:** Briefly state the strategy being applied by the system (e.g., "Trend-Following" or "Mean-Reversion").

3.  **Supporting Indicator Data (Contributors to the Signal):**
    *   **EMA Status:** e.g., "EMA9 above EMA21".
    *   **RSI Status:** e.g., "RSI (14): 65 - Bullish Momentum".
    *   **Volume Insights:** e.g., "Volume: Spike (2.1x average)" or "Volume: Normal".
    *   **Bollinger Bands:** e.g., "Price near Upper Bollinger Band".

4.  **Trade Execution Parameters (For BUY/SELL Signals):**
    *   **Signal Entry Price:** The price at which the signal was triggered.
    *   **Suggested Stop-Loss:** The calculated SL price.
    *   **Suggested Take-Profit:** The calculated TP price.
    *   **(Optional) Implied Risk/Reward Ratio:** e.g., "R:R approx 1:2.5".

5.  **Active Trade Management (If a position is open):**
    *   **Current Position:** "LONG", "SHORT", or "FLAT".
    *   **Trade Entry Price:** Price of the current open position.
    *   **Active Stop-Loss:** Current SL for the open position (note if moved to breakeven).
    *   **Active Take-Profit:** Current TP for the open position.
    *   **Trade Duration:** How long the current position has been open.

6.  **Data Integrity:**
    *   **Data Freshness Indicator:** Crucial for 5-minute charts, showing data age and source.

This user-centric view should guide the development and presentation of all dashboard elements.
## 📈 Recommended Dashboard Elements

The dashboard should surface the most actionable information at a glance so a
trader can quickly decide whether to enter or exit a position. Use these
components to maximize clarity, ensuring they deliver the "Key Information for Profitable Trading Decisions":

- **Central Signal Panel** – Prominently display the current core signal (BUY/SELL/HOLD), its confidence level, and a concise reason (e.g., "EMA Crossover + RSI Confirmation"). This is the primary action hub.
- **Market Regime Indicator** – Show whether the market is "Strong Trend", "Weak Trend", or "Ranging", and indicate the active trading strategy (e.g., "Trend-Following").
- **5‑Minute Candle Chart** – Candlesticks with EMA‑9/EMA‑21 overlays, volume bars, and markers for significant price moves or volume spikes. Consider overlaying Bollinger Bands here or in a separate panel.
- **RSI Panel** – Display current RSI value, its interpretation (e.g., "Bullish Momentum", "Oversold"), and highlight overbought/oversold zones.
- **Volume Insights Panel** – Show current volume relative to average (e.g., "Spike: 2.1x avg"), and potentially a mini volume trend indicator. This could integrate "Volume Spike Alerts".
- **Price Target & Risk Panel** – For active BUY/SELL signals, display the signal entry price, calculated stop-loss, take-profit levels, and the implied Risk/Reward ratio (e.g., "R/R: 1:2.5").
- **Active Trade Status Panel** – If a trade is open, show current position (LONG/SHORT), entry price, active SL/TP (noting if SL moved to breakeven), and trade duration.
- **Bollinger Bands Display** – Show current price in relation to Bollinger Bands (e.g., "Testing Upper Band"). This could be on the main chart or a dedicated small indicator.
- **Data Freshness Indicator** – Show the age and source of the data, critical for 5-minute analysis.
- **Performance Metrics Panel** – Track win rate, profit factor, and recent trade outcomes to evaluate signal reliability.
- **Quick Action Buttons** – Optional shortcuts for copying trade parameters or executing mock trades.

## Testing Results

### Current Status
- ✅ 16 test suites passing
- ❌ 2 test suites failing:
  - `market-regime.test.ts` - Issues with regime detection logic
  - `indicators.test.ts` - Indicator calculation discrepancies

### Issues Identified

#### Market Regime Detector
1. **Strong Trend Detection**:
   - Fails to detect strong trends with high confidence
   - ADX thresholds may need adjustment for shorter timeframes
   - Volume confirmation requirements too strict

2. **Ranging Market Detection**:
   - Overly sensitive to minor price movements
   - Needs better handling of low-volatility conditions

#### Indicator Calculations
1. **EMA Calculation**:
   - Slight discrepancies in EMA values compared to expected
   - May be due to initialization method

2. **RSI Calculation**:
   - Edge cases with all-rising or all-falling prices
   - Needs better handling of initial periods

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Fixes (1-2 hours)**
   - Adjust ADX thresholds for 5-minute timeframe
   - Fix EMA calculation to match standard implementations
   - Add more test cases for edge conditions

2. **Test Coverage (2-3 hours)**
   - Add unit tests for all indicator functions
   - Add integration tests for complete signal pipeline
   - Implement snapshot testing for UI components

3. **Documentation (1 hour)**
   - Update test documentation
   - Add comments explaining indicator calculations
   - Document expected input/output for all functions

### How to Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- market-regime.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
