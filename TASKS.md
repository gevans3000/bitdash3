## PHASE 1: CORE DATA FOUNDATION

### Step 1: Real-Time WebSocket Engine
- [ ] **WebSocket Connection:** Connect to `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/btcusdt@kline_5m`
- [ ] **Auto-Reconnect Logic:** Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s max)
- [ ] **Data Normalization:** Convert Binance format to standardized OHLCV objects
- [ ] **Latency Monitoring:** Track WebSocket vs REST API timing differences
- [ ] **Fallback System:** Switch to REST polling if WebSocket fails

### Step 2: Market Regime Detection (Critical for Profit)
- [ ] **ADX Calculation:** Implement 14-period Average Directional Index
- [ ] **Regime Classification:** 
  - ADX > 25 = Strong Trend (activate trend-following)
  - ADX 20-25 = Weak Trend (reduce position sizes)
  - ADX < 20 = Ranging Market (switch to mean-reversion)
- [ ] **Regime UI Indicator:** Large banner showing current market regime
- [ ] **Strategy Auto-Switch:** Different signal logic based on regime

### Step 3: Dynamic Volatility Engine
- [ ] **ATR Calculation:** 14-period Average True Range on 5m chart
- [ ] **Volatility Bands:** High (ATR > 80th percentile), Normal, Low (ATR < 20th percentile)
- [ ] **Adaptive Stops:** Stop-loss = Entry ± (2.5 × current ATR)
- [ ] **Position Sizing:** Auto-calculate based on 1% account risk with dynamic stops
- [ ] **Volatility Alerts:** Notify when ATR spikes >50% (breakout incoming)

- [ ] **Liquidity Grab Alerts:** Price spikes through levels then reverses (manipulation)

### Step 6: Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Engine
- [ ] **Price Differential Monitor:** Binance vs Gemini vs Coinbase real-time
- [ ] **Funding Rate Arbitrage:** Binance futures funding vs spot premium
- [ ] **Exchange Flow Signals:** Price gaps >0.15% often predict 5m momentum
- [ ] **Arbitrage Opportunity Alerts:** Sound/visual when spread >0.2%
- [ ] **Position Size Boost:** +50% position when clear arbitrage exists

## PHASE 3: INSTITUTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

### Step 7: Whale Movement Detection
- [ ] **Large Transaction Alerts:** 100+ BTC moves (Alpha Vantage API)
- [ ] **Exchange Inflow/Outflow:** Net BTC to exchanges = selling pressure
- [ ] **Whale Wallet Tracking:** Monitor top 100 addresses for accumulation
- [ ] **Institutional Buy/Sell Pressure:** Weight whale moves in signal scoring
- [ ] **Whale Alignment Bonus:** Extra confidence when whales agree with technicals

### Step 8: Macro & News Intelligence
- [ ] **Fed Calendar Integration:** Rate decisions, FOMC meeting impact
- [ ] **DXY Correlation Monitor:** Dollar strength vs BTC inverse relationship
- [ ] **S&P500 Correlation Breaks:** When BTC decouples from stocks (bullish)
- [ ] **Fear & Greed Contrarian:** Extreme fear (<20) = buy zone, Extreme greed (>80) = caution
- [ ] **CME Gap Detection:** Sunday futures gaps that often get filled within 48h

  - Volume Spike (>150% avg): +3 points
  - Whale Alignment: +4 points
  - Exchange Arbitrage (>0.15%): +3 points
  - 15m Trend Agreement: +2 points
  - Order Flow Confirmation: +2 points
- [ ] **Trade Threshold:** Only execute trades with score ≥12/19 points
- [ ] **Confidence Display:** Show percentage confidence for each signal

### Step 10: Bitcoin-Specific Profit Layers
- [ ] **Liquidation Cluster Analysis:** Identify where leveraged positions get liquidated
- [ ] **Funding Rate Extremes:** Long when funding <-0.1%, short when >0.3%
- [ ] **Hash Rate Correlation:** Major hash rate drops often precede price drops
- [ ] **Miner Capitulation Signals:** When miners sell reserves (accumulation opportunity)
- [ ] **MVRV Ratio Integration:** Market value to realized value for cycle positioning
